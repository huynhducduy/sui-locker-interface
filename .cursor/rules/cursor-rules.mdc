# Cursor Rules

The project rules located in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` are only for generic, global rules. For specific module/vertical, please place the rules in `notes.md` inside that specific work/feature folder `.works/*`

There are 2 types of rules:

1. Recommended: this type of rules is often well-known, gold standard, or proven, best practices. Should be easily shared between multiple projects
2. Custom: the type of rules is only valid to a specific project, and will make no sense or less sense if use for another projects

Be smart and determine if which type of rule it should be, if not, proactively ask.

Rule file structure:

```mdc
---
description: <description of the rule>
globs: <globs of the rule>
---
# <Name of the rule>

## Recommended

<List of recommended rules>

### <Sub-section>

<List of subsection recommended rules>

## Custom

<List of custom rules>

### <Sub-section>

<List of subsection custom rules>

```

There are some project rule files that are not follow this rule, DO NOT ATTEMPT to update them, unless requested specifically:

- memory-bank.mdc
- cursor-rules.mdc
