# Code Style

## Recommended

+ The filename should match the functionality
+ Follow SOLID principles, DRY, YAGNI, KISS, etc.
+ Prioritize reusability and modularity. Use abstraction to extract core logic and hide complexity, making code flexible and generic
+ Document complex types with JSDoc
+ Separate concerns: presentational components, business logic, side effects
+ Always write tests, type tests
+ Always try to add:
  + Informational log with `console.info` about the events, behaviors, etc
  + Fine-grained debug log with `console.debug` about the function/program state
  + Error log with `console.error` about the errors, bugs, etc
  + Warn log with `console.warn` about the warnings, potential issues, etc
+ Always try to keep the files small (< 300 lines of code) and focused, with single responsibility
+ Document and comment code clearly and concisely, focusing on "Why" rather than "What". Because "What" can be hidden with abstraction.

## Custom

+ You don't have to import libraries that are already auto-imported by `unplugin-auto-import` (read `auto-imports.d.ts` and `vite.config.ts` for the list).
