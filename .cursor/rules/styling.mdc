# Styling

## Recommended

+ Use CSS logical properties instead of physical properties (e.g., `inline-size` instead of `width`, `block-size` instead of `height`) for better RTL/LTR support
+ Use rem units for most measurements (margins, paddings, font sizes, borders, etc.) for better accessibility and scalability
+ Keep media query breakpoints in pixels for consistent behavior across devices
+ Use CSS variables for theming and consistent values across components

## Custom

+ Always use rem units instead of px for all measurements (borders, margins, paddings, sizes, etc.)
+ Follow the conversion ratio of 1px = 0.0625rem (based on 16px root font size)
+ Common conversions to remember:
  + 1px = 0.0625rem
  + 2px = 0.125rem
  + 20px = 1.25rem
  + 80px = 5rem
+ For pill-shaped or fully rounded elements, use `border-radius: 624.9375rem` (equivalent to 9999px) instead of `border-radius: 50%`
+ Use SCSS modules for component-scoped styles
+ Prioritize consistent measurement units throughout the codebase, even if it means having some unusual-looking numerical values
+ When making styling changes that affect multiple files, preserve existing patterns and minimize the scope of changes to reduce validation overhead

## Maintenance Philosophy

+ Systematic unit conversion (px to rem) across the entire codebase improves both maintainability and accessibility
+ Prefer consistent patterns over introducing new methodologies when working with existing code
+ When working with large-scale changes that are difficult to validate visually, make only necessary changes
