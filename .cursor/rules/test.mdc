# Testing

## Recommended

+ Use `vitest` as the testing framework
+ Write both runtime and type tests when applicable
+ Organize tests in descriptive nested describe blocks
+ Use `expect` for runtime assertions
+ Use `expectTypeOf` for type assertions
+ Reset mocks between tests using `beforeEach`
+ Test basic cases, edge cases, and complex scenarios
+ Test error handling explicitly
+ Follow consistent test patterns:
  + Basic validation
  + Transformations
  + Complex scenarios
  + Error handling
  + Edge cases
+ Name test files consistently:
  + `.test.ts` for runtime tests
  + `.test-d.ts` for type tests
+ Write clear test descriptions that explain the expected behavior
+ Use test utilities appropriately (vi.fn(), expectTypeOf)
+ Test error handlers and their arguments
+ Verify both positive and negative test cases
+ Test empty/invalid inputs
+ Test complex transformations thoroughly

## Custom

+ Keep unit tests in the same place as the function they are testing, use `__tests__` folder only when the tests are many functions/components involved
