# Accessibility, Compatibility, SEO

## Recommended

+ Always include accessibility considerations to make sure that every users (visual impaired, colorblind, keyboard only users, etc.) can use the component with ease and no discrimination. (like adding custom `aria` attribute, checking the contrast level of colors,...)
+ Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices
+ Optimize for SEO when applicable
+ Consider internationalization requirements

## Custom

<!-- Add project-specific a11y, compatibility, and SEO rules here -->
